In this JSX React component Checkpoint, I aim to create simply JSON file in product.js which was referenced in four major components, Name.js, Description.js, Price.js and Name.js.

The other jsx component are primarily for styling/semantic purpose only. hence created with jsx extension to differentiate from the .js component requested in this checkpoint.

All component are imported and rendered in the App.js component.
